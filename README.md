# Expresso Martini – Landing Page for Restaurant and Bar

This project is an interactive landing page designed for Expresso Martini, a restaurant with a unique concept that transitions from a coffee shop by day to a restaurant/bar by night. The page automatically adapts its theme based on the time of day, switching between a light theme (for the day) and a dark theme (for the night). Additionally, there’s a button allowing users to manually toggle between the two themes, offering a personalized experience.

Features:
Responsive and adaptive design.

Automatic theme switch based on the time of day.

Manual theme toggle for users.

Focus on smooth and attractive user experience.

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic and modern interface.
